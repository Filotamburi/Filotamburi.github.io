            <p> Socjal Club is an instagram native startup and fashion brand started in 2018 between Milan and Miami. The brand follows the concept of american streetwear mixed with a more classical and european view of fashion. The purpose of the brand is described by its name. Socjal because the goal of the brand is to recreate and expand the experience of social media onto a clothing brand. Club because it started from a group of friends around the world into fashion, social life and social media and it's built on exclusivity and networking. The brand is expanding outside of the fashion industry and it's starting to represent a lifestyle and a movement built on modern culture and social media.</p>

<div class="modernculture"><p>Throughout human history new technologies of communication have always had a significant impact on culture but never like today. Nowadays, social media play a huge role in society and in our everyday life to a point where they almost define and represent our culture. The intermeshing of the virtual with the “real” dictates the reality of contemporary culture.

After having observed and interacted in the social media world and in particular on Instagram last year, Filippo Tamburi (Founder and Creative Director of Socjal Club) identified and selected the people who had the biggest influence and success among the youth, particularly in the fashion industry, but also in technology & innovation, probably the most relevant and exciting topic today.

</p>
  <p>Filippo decided to bring his idea to life by translating it into a piece of art. A picture to portrait and symbolize this last year of social media and fashion culture by putting together the 4 biggest and most relevant influencers in the field, next to each other as if they were in the same team, an ideal team to represent “Modern Culture”.</p>

  <p>Founder and creative director of the brand, Filippo Tamburi launched his first collection with Socjal Club in March 2018. He then released a summer limited edition collection and finally the last one, Modern Culture. Filippo is managing all the aspects of the brand from production to design, to marketing and distribution. Filippo was featured in some of the most important fashion magazine and newspapers like MF Fashion, recently invated to showcase his brand by IE university at their Fashion show in Madrid on innovative and sustainable clothing. Filippo also recently launched his first event with Socjal Club at Club Blume in Miami and sold out the club in less than 20 minutes. While he's experimenting with Socjal Club and seeing in what direction he'll want to take the brand he is about to release his first personal collection that is going to be sold using the socjal club platform but it is not going to be considered part of the brand. </p>
  <p>Filippo is also working on many other creative projects and will be working this summer with the Moncler Genius team in Milan, one of the most important creative teams in fashion in the world at the moment and with designers such us Francesco Ragazzi, founder of Palm Angels and Matthew Williams, founder of Alyx. With no background in fashion Filippo took the brand pretty far in a year and we'll see with the next collections in the upcoming months how the future of Filippo Tamburi and Socjal Club will be.</p>

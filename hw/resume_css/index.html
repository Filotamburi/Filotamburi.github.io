    <h2>Creative Entrepreneur</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> Born in <b>Milan</b> in <b>1998</b>, I studied in Italy for most of my life. I moved to the United States at the age of 16 and decided to conclude my High School studies in a boarding school in Boca Raton, Florida. I graduated from High Schol in 2017 and was admitted at the University of Miami where I am currently <b>majoring in Entrepreneurship and minoring in Motion Pictures</b>. I always wanted to merge my passion for the arts with my passion for business and decided to create a Brand called "Socjal Club" that started as a fashion brand but with the goal of expanding outside of its industry. I consider myself to be a <b>Creative Entrepreneur</b>. </p>
